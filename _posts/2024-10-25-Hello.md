The Diya lamp, an oil lamp made from clay or mud with cotton wick dipped in ghee (clarified butter), which are used in Hindu rituals. It is known to be the symbol of knowledge, purity, and the divine presence in both spiritual and physical realms. Traditionally crafted by artisans in India, Diyas are made for worshippers across generations.  Whether handmade or mass-produced for celebrations like **Diwali**, the spiritual goal of each Diya is to establish a connection with the divine.

The Diya is used by worshippers, primarily in Hinduism, though it is also used in Jain and Sikh rituals. It is found in family shrines, temples, and homes. Its size is typically small enough to fit in one’s palm, this makes it easy to place in different parts of a sacred space, allowing divine light  to permeate many areas symbolizing omnipresence. 

The Diya’s materials, which are made up of clay and brass, embody the qualities of durability and humility. Brass Diyas last longer and are frequently handed down through the generations, clay Diyas on the other hand, are usually thrown away, representing the passing away of life. The Diya produces a soft, earthy aroma and a warm glow when lit with oil or ghee, creating a peaceful and spiritually uplifting experience.

A senior family member is usually there to aid when lighting a Diya because it takes some ability to prepare  the wick and keep the flame going. The peaceful ambiance created by the Diya’s gentle radiance against the night is perfect for prayer and meditation. It is utilized in everyday pujas and the aarti ceremony, when the lamp is circled to honour the gods, as well as in festivals like Diwali, where millions of Diyas symbolize the triumph of light over darkness.

Anyone can utilize the Diya in worship because of its accessibility and simplicity, even yet it represents supernatural authority and might. By increasing worship and facilitating a direct, intimate relationship with the divine, this accessibility transfers symbolic authority from the established religious hierarchy to the individual.

In Hindu rituals, the Diya lamp essentially represents spiritual light and heavenly presence. Its accessibility and simplicity make it an effective instrument for building a closer relationship with the divine, enhancing both individual and group worship.
